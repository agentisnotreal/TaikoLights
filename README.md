# Taiko Lights

Activate Corsair iCUE lights when playing a Taiko no Tatsujin game on PC (emulated)! I might be the only one who would have a use case for this though lol.

## Prerequisites
- Corsair iCUE
- A controller (such as the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller)

## In Action
This code uses **Control Type 2** from Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun & Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival. Motion controls not supported.

On the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller:
| Buttons            | Colour |
|--------------------|--------|
| A, B, X, Y,  D-Pad | Red    |
| L, R, ZL, ZR       | Blue   |
